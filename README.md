# Dumb Instagram

A fair use parody of Instagram.

## Tech Stack

- Typescript
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node.js
- GraphQL

## Todo

- set up post photos
- delete photos and replace when pushed to same cloudinary URL
- change image size/quality/other cloudinary settings
- destroy token when user deleted
- going to need some privacy settings
- users could possibly manipulate url to find other user's private photos
